# Backend-Driven Chess Web Application with Dynamic Backend Processing

## Overview
A two-player chess game web application with a focus on backend processing. The front-end is a single static page that communicates with the server to process moves and update the game state.

## Components
- **index.html**: User interface for players.
- **app.py**: Server file bridging client and backend.
- **control.py**: Manages data flow and processing.
- **database_access.py**: Simulates DBMS for accessing `database.txt`.
- **chess.py**: Contains game logic and rules.
- **database.txt**: Stores game-related data.

## Features
- Backend-loaded architecture for robust game logic.
- Simple front-end interface.
- Central control for smooth backend operations.
- Efficient game state and database management.


## Usage
- Open `index.html` in a web browser.
- Make chess moves and see updates rendered from the backend.
